Diego Luna, the talented Mexican actor known for his roles in films like *Rogue One* and *Y Tu Mamá También*, isn't publicly known for being a soccer enthusiast or having a professional involvement in the sport. However, like many people, he might enjoy playing or watching soccer as a fan, but there’s no widely available info linking him closely to the game or any particular team. 

Are you curious about his personal interests or maybe how he’s connected to sports in general? Or are you looking for something more playful or speculative, like imagining him as a soccer player?
