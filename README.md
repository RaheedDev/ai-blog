The goal is to create an AI-powered blogging website that automatically generates and publishes SEO-friendly blog articles each week based on trending topics from Google Trends RSS. The system will use Pollination AI to generate blog content, with automation orchestrated through n8n, which will fetch trends, generate the article and image (via Pollinations or Unsplash API), convert it into MDX format, and push it to a GitHub repository. The site will be built using Next.js with or next-mdx-remote for managing content in /content/blogs/, and deployed via Vercel for fast, free hosting. Monetization will be handled through Google AdSense, which can be applied after 10 posts are live and indexed, using <ins> components. Optionally, low-performing posts (based on view stats tracked via Firebase or Analytics) will be auto-deleted after 30 days using GitHub API. The website’s visual design should follow a neobrutalist theme — clean and minimal yet colorful and visually attractive, offering a unique and modern aesthetic that engages users while maintaining readability and performance.# ai-blog
