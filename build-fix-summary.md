# Build Issues Fixed

## Issues Found and Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Character Encoding Issue
- **Problem**: Invalid character `Â©` in Footer.tsx
- **Fix**: Replaced with proper `©` symbol

### 2. ✅ Line Clamp CSS Issues
- **Problem**: Using `line-clamp-2` and `line-clamp-3` without proper Tailwind plugin
- **Fix**: Replaced with inline CSS using `-webkit-box` properties
- **Files Fixed**: 
  - `app/page.tsx` 
  - `app/blog/page.tsx`

### 3. ✅ Tailwind Configuration
- **Problem**: Missing line-clamp plugin configuration
- **Fix**: Removed plugin requirement and used CSS-in-JS approach

## Remaining Potential Issues to Check:

### 1. Environment Variables
Make sure you have a `.env.local` file with required variables:
```
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_secret_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_CLIENT_ID=ca-pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### 2. Missing Dependencies
If build still fails, you might need to install missing packages:
```bash
npm install
npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
npm install @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom
```

### 3. TypeScript Strict Mode
The tsconfig.json has `"strict": true` which might cause issues. If needed, you can temporarily set it to `false`.

### 4. MDX Content Issues
Check if any MDX files have malformed frontmatter or content.

## Build Command to Test:
